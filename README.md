Selenium 4.x Learning & Practice Repository

This repository is my personal learning lab for mastering Web Automation with Selenium 4.x.

📚 What’s Inside

I’ll be implementing concepts step by step:

Getting Started

Setting up Java, Maven, and IDE (IntelliJ / Eclipse)

Running the first Selenium script

Browser drivers & WebDriver basics

Core Selenium

Locators (ID, Name, Class, XPath, CSS)

Navigation & WebElement interactions

Handling Alerts, Checkboxes, Radio Buttons, Dropdowns, and Web Tables

Selenium Waits (Implicit, Explicit, Fluent)

Advanced Selenium

Actions (Keyboard & Mouse Events)

Windows & Iframes handling

JavaScript Executor

Handling Dynamic Elements, SVG, and Shadow DOM

Framework & Utilities

TestNG Integration

Data Driven Testing with Apache POI

Page Object Model (POM & Page Factory)

Logging with Log4j

Allure Reports

Execution Environments

Selenium Grid & Parallel Execution

Running on Docker

Cloud Providers (BrowserStack, etc.)

Jenkins Integration for CI/CD

🚀 How I’ll Use This Repo

Each concept will have examples, notes, and assignments.

Code will be committed step by step as I progress.

Assignments (like automating the VWO login page, handling waits, SVG clicks, etc.) will be included.

Final goal: Build a mini Selenium Automation Framework from scratch.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Language: Java

Automation Tool: Selenium 4.x

🎯 Goal

By the end of this repo, I aim to:

Be comfortable with Selenium automation end-to-end.

Build a reusable framework for web test automation.

Gain confidence for interviews & real project work.
